<h4 id="people_as_programmers">People As Programmers</h4>

<ol>
<li>I see a little bit of myself in most of the programmer predilections from A-Z with respect to the technical inclinations and not so much the personal idiosyncrasies. Specifically, I&#8217;m similar to Belligerent Brian and possibly Zealous Zack when it comes to my propensity to &#8220;select cutting edge technologies simply for its buzzword compliance, betting that cool acronyms and shiny new methodologies will make me appear progressive and forward-looking.&#8221; I can also be a bit of a Feature Creep Frank when I indulge in personal projects in that I simply fail to exercise any form of self-restrain from adding a myriad of cool but often frivolous features.</li>
<li>Computer Programmers feel that coding is the entirety of their job. It can be said that they are slightly narrow-minded in that they work to close bug tracker issues, while Software Developers have a broad view and deep understanding of the business goals and works to deliver business value and uses technology as a means to an end to solving business problems. It is unlikely that the proverbial &#8220;person-in-the-street.&#8221; <em>Their intent is to solve a business problem, not just to close an issue in a bug tracking system.</em></li>

<h4 id="software_requirements">Software Requirements</h4>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>What happened to the Mars Polar Lander in 1999?</strong></p>

<p>The software triggered the shutdown of the Landerâ€™s descent engines, believing that the Lander had already landed on the surface of Mars.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>What went wrong?</strong></p>

<p>The essential problem was a breakdown in communication of software requirements. The revised requirements never made it into the lower-level requirements. The testing process was also lax in that full regression testing was not performed, so after certain changes were made and bug fixes were done, only a part of the overall system was tested and the touchdown sensor bugs were not detected as a result. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>What lessons can you learn about team-based software development from this?</strong></p>

<p>The importance of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Communication</li>
<li>Requirement Tracking</li>
<li>Regression Testing</li>
</ul></li>

<h4 id="10_elements_of_good_software_design">10 Elements of Good Software Design</h4>

<ol>
<li>TBH, I feel like most of the elements listed were slightly esoteric at this stage, only understandable by seasoned Object-Oriented developers&#8230; But otherwise, everything else was pretty much common-sense and hard not to agree with, e.g.
<ul>
<li>Provides The Necessary Functionality</li>
<li>Is As Simple As Current And Foreseeable Constraints Will Allow</li>
<li>Eliminates Duplication</li>
<li>Is Robustly Documented</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Yes. I feel the order of important is reasonable, given the important of the thing being designed to meet its purpose, and also being as simple as possible.</li>
<li><p>The above points are consistent with these points from Dieter Rams:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Good design makes a product useful</p>

<p><em>Synonymous with &#8220;Provides The Necessary Functionality&#8221;.</em></p></li>
<li><p>Good design is as little design as possible</p>

<p><em>Consistent with being as simple as current and foreseeable constraints will allow.</em></p></li>
<li><p>Good design is long-lasting</p>

<p><em>A robustly documented product should make the design long-lasting.</em></p></li>
<li><p>Good design makes a product understandable</p>

<p><em>Simplicity, and robust documentation should make the product understandable.</em></p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
