This is my `git` repository for my laboratory and project work this semester. 

The sole purpose of hosting this repository publicly on GitHub is to faciliate the ease of collaboration with group projects and assignments, revision control and source code management.

It is *not* intended as a means of distributing homework solutions, but I'm simply too cheap to get a private repository at this point. 

That said, you are welcome to use or distribute this code so long as it does not infringe on the [CSE Student Plagiarism Policy](http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/people/studentoffice/policies/plagiarism.html).
